Enable, configure, and use webhooks for your Comments integration. Common use cases for Comments webhooks include:

- Sending notifications when a thread is created, resolved, updated, or deleted.
- Notifying users when comments are added, updated, or deleted.
- In conjunction with the [mention extension](/editor/extensions/nodes/mention), sending emails or notifications to users when they are mentioned in comments.

## Enable comment events

If you signed up for your account after March 1st 2024, Comment webhooks are enabled by default. There's no additional action required on your part to start receiving Comment webhook events.

If your account was created before March 1st and you're using an older version of the webhook system, you'll need to manually enable the new webhooks. Here's how:

1. In case you’ve already implemented a previous Collaboration webhook, make sure to check the “type” and “trigger” fields when processing incoming webhooks. ([Documentation](/collaboration/core-concepts/webhooks))
2. Navigate to the [Collaboration settings](https://cloud.tiptap.dev/apps/settings) in your account.
3. Locate the Webhook section and click on the "Upgrade" button.

This upgrade is necessary to accommodate the introduction of multiple new events being routed to the same webhook endpoint, distinguished by a new `type` and `trigger` field.

## Configure Webhooks

To configure webhooks for Comments notifications:

1. Navigate to the [Collaboration settings](https://cloud.tiptap.dev/apps/settings) in your account.
2. Find the webhooks section and add your desired endpoint URL.

After adding your URL, the webhook is immediately live. You'll start receiving notifications for the specified events without any delay.

## Webhook Events

Comments webhooks trigger notifications for a variety of events related to threads and comments within the Comments extension. These events are triggered immediately upon the respective action occurring in the Comments.

- `comment.added`
- `comment.updated`
- `comment.deleted`
- `thread.created`
- `thread.resolved`
- `thread.updated`
- `thread.deleted`
